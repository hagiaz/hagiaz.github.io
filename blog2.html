            <p class="content"><span class="firstletter">R</span>ecently, I’ve been doing a fair
                bit of travelling. As I move into my 33rd year on this world, I’m starting to think
                about maybe changing things up a bit. I might stay in Osaka, or I may go elsewhere
                in Japan. It is, as of yet, undecided. However, one of the tangential pleasures to
                be derived from such a situation is the opportunity to travel around as I meet new
                companies and explore new opportunities.
                <br>
            </p>

            <p class="content">In these times of budget airlines, last minute bookings and cheap
                flights galore, many people favour the airplane as their preferred method of transportation.
                However, for me, when it comes to getting around Japan in style, nothing beats the
                Shinkansen, Japan’s bullet train, which recently celebrated 50 years of service.
                It’s hard to believe that the high speed network is now into its 6th decade, whilst
                back in the UK the government still debates whether or not to approve one high speed
                line, which of course will run only between Birmingham and that self-appointed centre
                of the known universe, London.
                <br>
            </p>

            <p class="content">Meanwhile Japan has recently expanded its Shinkansen network
                into Hokkaido and work is well underway on the next generation of shinkansen,
                expected to be completed sometime in the 2020s that will halve the travelling
                time between Osaka and Tokyo. Nonetheless, the shinkansen remains an expensive
                venture. With a standard one-way ticket between Tokyo and Osaka coming in at
                around 14,000 yen, it’s almost 3 times the price of the cheapest budget airline
                flight between Kansai International Airport and Narita.
                <br>
            </p>

            <p class="content">Also, on paper at least, an airline flight would seem the more
                effective in terms of time management, with a flight from Osaka to Tokyo taking
                around 1 hour, compared to the 3 hours or so it takes to travel via the fastest
                shinkansen. However, the whole “one hour to Toyko” idea is somewhat disingenuous.
                One needs to remember that to get from central Osaka to Kansai Airport, even by
                the express train still takes around 1 hour. Then, as is standard on all domestic
                flights, one must check-in no later than 1 hour before take-off. Also, Narita is
                in the proverbial “middle of nowhere” not in fact in Tokyo, but rural Chiba prefecture,
                at least an hour outside the main centre of Tokyo.
                <br>

            <p class="content">So, suddenly we have a 4 hour journey involving a plane and at
                least 2 trains, versus a 3 hour commute via one, luxurious train, with ample legroom!
                <br>
            </p>

            <p class="content">Yes, indeed I believe the Shinkansen is truly worth that little bit
                of extra financial outlay, for those who can afford it. The seats are comfortable,
                the journey smooth. Delays almost never happen, unless there are extreme weather
                conditions like heavy snow or torrential rain, and good luck getting a flight in
                those conditions! Of course it’s not just the efficiency of the Shinkansen that makes
                me love it so, it’s also the general ambiance. From the minute you embark until the
                moment you arrive at your destination, there’s a feeling of luxury, of comfort, of pampering.
                <br>
            </p>

            <p class="content">Certainly, airlines could learn a lot from the spacious gangways and oversized,
                soft, reclinable seats. However, all this is just window dressing. For me, what really sets the
                Shinkansen apart from other forms of transport is the service and the hospitality. The staff
                are always immaculately turned out, and never hesitate to bow respectfully as they enter
                and leave each carriage. Indeed, this is very much a futuristic venture with a traditional heart.
                <br>
            </p>

            <p class="content">The charm offensive continues when you see the food and drink assortment.
                One thing that the Shinkansen is world famous for is its Bento boxes. These boxed lunches
                are as beautiful as they are delicious. Each one has a variety of small Japanese traditional
                dishes laid out in such a decorative, artistic fashion, one would almost feel guilty about
                eating it. Almost that is! And unlike most of the rail companies back in the UK, price gouging
                isn’t really a thing here in Japan. The food and drinks that you can buy on the Shinkansen are
                perhaps a little more expensive than what one would expect to pay in a convenience store like 7
                Eleven, but nothing like the blatant extortion I’ve experienced on my occasional journeys between
                Scotland and England. Anyway, I digress.
                <br>
            </p>

            <img class="d-block mx-auto mt-4" src="Assets/shinkansen3.jpg" style="width: 40%; border-radius: 10%; box-shadow:5px 5px #000000; padding: 0; margin-bottom: 3rem;">

            <p class="content">In the modern world, another important feature is the capacity to work
                while you travel and again the Shinkansen meets this requirement. Every seat as a fold
                down table, which unlike those tiny little plastic slabs the airlines use, these will
                actually support a laptop and will allow you to get those all important documents fully
                typed and edited before your meeting.
                <br>
            </p>

            <p class="content">Wi-fi is also being rolled out on the Shinkansen lines now, and while
                access is still a bit hit and miss, it’s surely only a matter of time before it becomes
                a regular feature on all services. So, for comfort, service and just the all-round
                pleasure of the experience, you can keep your budget airlines. It’s the Shinkansen all
                the way for me!
