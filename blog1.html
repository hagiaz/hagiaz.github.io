            <p class="content"><span class="firstletter">W</span>ith panoramic views of the bay, 
              there’s a reason South Lombok will leave you speechless. Lombok is a small island 
              off the East coast of Bali, in Indonesia. With blindingly white sand and crystal 
              clear water, this tiny island is known for its dive sites and surfing.
              Since the airport opened in 2011, the island has become more accessible
              than ever. Kuta, the main town off the southern coast of Lombok, has blossomed with new
              hotels, cafes, and restaurants, and has quickly become the perfect spot for your next
              vacation.<br>
            </p>

            <p class="content">During my visit, I stayed in Kuta. It’s neighbor, Bali, has a beach
              also named Kuta so don’t get the two mixed up because they are very different.
              In South Lombok, you’ll find coffee shops, bungalows, endless amounts of Mediterranean
              food, and plenty of surfing. You’ll also find a few lodging options to choose from.
              <br>
            </p>

            <p class="content">Lamancha Homestay: Lamancha is only a 4-minute walk from the beach
              and contains ten rooms filled with colorful tiles and tapestries. Each room has a
              terrace with garden views, and you can enjoy an a la carte or halal breakfast while
              you enjoy the warm air.
              <br>
            </p>

            <p class="content">Bombora Bungalows: The rooms are in fact bungalows, and the
              Bombora Bungalows offer many amenities such as free wifi, housekeeping, balconies,
              and a gorgeous pool that you can spend your days in. The best part is that rooms
              start at $24 a night.
              <br>
            </p>

            <p class="content">Surfer’s Inn: Surfer’s Inn was built following the local architectural
              style with a lot of colors. There are 25 rooms, a swimming pool, a bar, and a restaurant.
              Plus the rooms start at only USD $14 a night, and is also close to the beach.
              <br>
            </p>

            <p class="content">When in Lombok, you’ll absolutely want to rent a motorbike. It’s a
              necessity! Luckily there are motorbike rentals all over the island. If you’re staying
              at Same Same, they offer some. If not, there are also many bike rental spots all over.
              <br>

            <p class="content">Let’s be honest, visiting South Lombok is all about visiting the beaches.
              My favorite is Tanjung Aan beach,  Located 20 minutes east of Kuta, you’ll find two bays made
              up of incredibly white sandy beaches. In between, there is a viewpoint of the two coves that
              offers a 360-degree view of both coves. It’s one of the best spots to watch the sunset.
              There are also a few warungs nearby that offer delicious food and drink. If you do purchase something,
              many of them offer lounge chairs and umbrellas that you can use on the beach for free.
              <br>
            </p>

            <p class="content">My other favorite is Mawi beach. If you’re an experienced surfer, Mawi
              Beach is the best place to catch some waves while you’re visiting South Lombok. With the
              coral reefs, sharp rocks, and strong currents, the waves are fast making them a bit harder
              for beginners. There is no public transportation to the beach so you’ll want to have your
              motorbike ready to go. The waves are small and the water is sparkling clean making it the
              ideal place to spend a beach day and relax.
              <br>
            </p>

            <p class="content">Lombok is such a fun little island to explore if you are traveling through
              the region! It is on the calmer side when coming from Bali, which makes it the perfect place
              for some true relaxation.
              <br>
