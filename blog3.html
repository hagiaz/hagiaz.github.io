            <p class="content"><span class="firstletter">N</span>Nara, Japan is an excellent place to visit,
              and a big part of this is the wild deer that roam the city. If you’ve ever thought to yourself,
              “gee, I really want to go to a park where I can interact with and feed over one thousand deer”
              then it’s time to book your trip to Nara, one of our favorite cities in Japan.
              <br>
            </p>

            <p class="content">Let’s start with a brief update. It’s been a tough year for the
              devious deer of Nara. Tourism came to a screeching halt in Japan’s ancient capital
              last year, and their main source of food–deer crackers and other handouts–disappeared
              almost overnight. As a result, the hungry deer reverted to their natural foraging
              instincts.
              <br>
            </p>

            <p class="content">The Nara Deer Preservation Foundation and Hokkaidō University
              studied the animals’ behavior to document the degree to which the deer were changing.
              Researchers found that deer in the central area of Nara Park normally frequented by
              tourists dropped from 71.9% of the herd to 50.2% during daytime hours, and down from
              56.5% to 34.9% at night. With significantly fewer people visiting, deer reverted to
              natural nocturnal habits and were also spending more time grazing in areas adjacent
              to the park.
                <br>
            </p>

            <p class="content">The study and researcher conclusions are interesting. It remains to
              be seen what measures are taken to reduce friction between humans and deer once tourists
              inevitably return. The now slightly less tame deer could butt heads with people more
              often at first, both figuratively and literally. (Or rather, butt rear-ends in the
              literal sense!). In other positive deer of Nara news, the first deer fawn to be born
              this year in Nara Park was unveiled on May 10, 2021! The newly born female fawn will
              be displayed at Rokuen, a facility in the park where deer are kept, beginning June 1,
              2021. She will be released into the park with other deer in late July 2021, according
              to the Nara Deer Preservation Foundation.

            <p class="content">Around 200 fawns are born in the park each year, with late May to
              mid-June being the peak period of their delivery. The park did not display a fawn
              last year; this small bit of news is meant to provide a bit of optimism and hope
              for more normalcy on the horizon. On that note, we’ll turn to how things normally
              work with Nara’s devious deer. The city was actually the first permanent capitol of
              Japan, and has a variety of shrines, temples, and ruins that are collectively a UNESCO
              World Heritage Site. We’ve stayed in the city a few times, and regularly do day trips
              from Kyoto via the JR Nara Line.
              <br>
            </p>

            <p class="content">Actually, the ‘Nara Deer Park’ as it’s known is home to over 1,000 deer.
              It’s an open, public park, not a park in the sense that it’s a petting zoo for deer.
              Technically, these deer are wild, but only in the sense that there are no cages or fences
              keeping them in place. This is evidenced by the fact that they tend to roam outside of Nara
              Deer Park and can be found scattered across Nara. When I say “scattered about,” I really
              mean it. The deer are everywhere, from lingering at the entrance to restaurants to temples
              to roads. Drivers simply wait until the deer decide to move out of the way–I’ve never
              witnessed anyone honking at them.
              <br>
            </p>

            <p class="content">You’ll also see them in a variety of other places where you wouldn’t
              expect to find deer (in reality, I can’t think of many urban environments where you’d
              “expect” to find deer, but that’s besides the point); they’re all over the place in Nara.
              They are devious little guys! Semi-tame and free-roaming are probably the most apt terms
              to describe the devious deer of Nara. If domesticated and wild are the two ends of the
              spectrum, they’re still closer to wild, though.
              <br>
            </p>

            <img class="d-block mx-auto mt-4" src="Assets/nara3.jpg" style="width: 40%; border-radius: 10%; box-shadow:5px 5px #000000; padding: 0; margin-bottom: 3rem;">

            <p class="content">The deer have been semi-domesticated as they have been in such close
              proximity to humans for so long, and the handouts people give them pretty much guarantee
              that they aren’t going anywhere. I mean, if you were a deer living the posh life of being
              feed crackers, living in a nicely manicured park, and not being hunted, would you really
              give that up? Not that deer really think about this that rationally, but I think the food
              is the only “justification” they need.
              <br>
            </p>

            <p class="content">The deer are active at all hours of the day, looking for their next
              handout, but with few people around at night, most of them just rest on the ground.
              I assume fall is mating season for deer in Japan, as I don’t know why else some of
              the bucks would have been carrying on as they were, essentially crying for the doe
              to…partake in some deer recreation. The doe, such as the one above, showed no interest,
              only causing the bucks to wail more. C’mon guys, show some class!
              <br>
            </p>

            <p class="content">The deer were absolutely fearless towards human. Thinking it might be
              food, they would come within inches of my camera. Realizing it was not food, they’d
              voice their disdain for me. They were just as approachable as the adult deer, but weren’t
              so pushy about being fed. Once the deer had their fill of food, they would generally just
              wander off and lie down in whatever random spot they could find. It was on the chillier
              side when we visited, and we spotted many under lights or sunlit locations.
              <br>
            </p>

            <p class="content">Unlike the Japanese Macaque at Kyoto Monkey Park, who act like petulant
              children throwing a temper tantrum, slamming things around and darting at people if they
              don’t get what they want, these deer will give you a friendly “nudge”, but don’t force
              the issue.
              <br>
            </p>

            <p class="content">Overall, Nara is an awesome place, and I highly recommend visiting.
              Not just for the deer, but for the variety of UNESCO World Heritage Sites, the eclectic
              culture, and quaintness of this “small town” feeling area (oh, and let’s not forget the
              main reason: NARA DREAMLAND!). It’s a nice day trip from Kyoto, and is easy to access
              for those with a JR Pass. If it’s your first visit to Japan and you have limited time,
              I probably would skip Nara, but it’s a good option that’s quite a bit different from
              the major cities and worth visiting if you have 10+ days in Japan. As for the Nara Deer
              Park, once you’re in Nara, you’re going to experience the “park” whether you go to it
              or not, but you should definitely go into the park itself (it’s a free public park) as
              that’s the epicenter of deer-happenings.
